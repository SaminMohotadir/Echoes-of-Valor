# Echoes of Valor

Yo, this is my RPG game project I just started messing with in C++.  
Right now, it’s mostly about making your character and setting up the code so I can add more cool stuff later.

Oh, and btw — I’m self-taught and still in class 7.  
My school doesn’t teach coding or anything like that, so this is all me grinding on my own.I have been doing c++ for a little over a month

## What it does so far

- Make your own character — name, pick a class, get some stats  
- Code split up nice and clean so I don’t go crazy later  
- Just a simple text menu for now

## Stuff I wanna add later

- Actual game stuff like quests and fighting  
- Different classes and abilities  
- Saving your progress so you don’t lose hours  
- More cool game features when I figure them out

## How to run it

Clone the repo, compile the code with whatever C++ compiler you got, and run it.  
Easy.

## Wanna help or got tips?

Hit me up with issues or comments. Always down to get better.
